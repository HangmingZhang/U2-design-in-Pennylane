# U2-design-in-Pennylane
# Introduction
Hello, I'm Hangming Zhang. This repository provides a simplified implementation of the unitary 2-design method for quantum error mitigation.
# Key Features
(1) Implements unitary 2-design based on its fundamental mathematical formulation. <br>
(2) Built using PennyLane for quantum circuit simulation. <br>
(3) Offers a reference implementation not currently available in PennyLane (to the best of my knowledge).
# Implementation Notes
While this implementation may differ from practical unitary 2-design applications, it focuses on: <br>
Verifying the mathematical correctness of the approach. <br>
Serving as an educational reference. <br>
Providing a foundation for further development.
